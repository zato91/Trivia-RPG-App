>  A game application based by the legendary old school beat’em up, Street of Rage. Players will have to answer trivia questions correctly to land a successful attack. After 3 waves of enemies, a boss will appear. Defeat the bosses to win the game, but if the player’s health drops to zero, you are defeated!
